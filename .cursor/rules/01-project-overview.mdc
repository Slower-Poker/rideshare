# Project Overview

**RideShare.Click** (rideshare.click) is a cooperative ride-sharing platform for community-based transportation. Users can offer rides as hosts, book rides as riders, join driver or rider pools, and manage connections (vouches) for trust. The app supports optional login: guests can browse; signing in is required to book, offer, or use pools and connections.

## Access Levels

### Unauthenticated Users (Optional Login)
**Can browse without signing in:**
- ✅ View home and map
- ✅ Browse ride listings and details (where exposed)
- ✅ Access My Account page (with sign-in UI)
- ❌ Cannot book rides (authentication required)
- ❌ Cannot offer rides
- ❌ Cannot use Ride Planner chat (Nova)
- ❌ Cannot manage pools or connections

### Authenticated Users
**Full access when signed in:**
- **Host**: Create ride offers (origin, destination, time, seats, price), manage participants
- **Rider**: Search/find rides, request to join, manage bookings
- **Pools**: Create or join driver pools (HostPool) or rider pools (RiderPool)
- **Connections**: Send/accept connection requests; give/receive “know person” ratings
- **Ride Planner**: Use AI chat (Nova Agent proxy) for trip planning
- **Account**: Profile, terms acceptance, ratings, coop member number

## Core Flows

- **Book a ride**: Find a ride → details → confirm booking (RideParticipant)
- **Offer a ride**: Create RideOffer (origin, destination, time, seats, price)
- **Request a ride**: Create RideRequest (pickup, dropoff, time, seats, max amount)
- **Pools**: HostPool / RiderPool with members and reviews
- **Connections**: Connection (vouch) between users; supports “know person” ratings
- **Ratings**: RideRating (driver/rider, verified_ride or know_person) after rides or for connections

## Tech Philosophy

**MVP focused on core functionality.**

Prioritize:
- Working features over perfect architecture
- User experience over complex optimizations
- Clear code over clever code
- SSO authentication over custom auth
- Explicit validation and ownership checks for mutations

Refactor and optimize as the product grows.
