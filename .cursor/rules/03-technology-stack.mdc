# Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Frontend** | React 19+ with TypeScript | Strict mode enabled |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Core utilities only |
| **Icons** | lucide-react | Consistent icon library |
| **Notifications** | React Toastify | Use toast functions, NOT alert() |
| **Maps** | Leaflet + react-leaflet | Map views and ride locations |
| **Backend** | AWS Amplify Gen 2 | Fully implemented |
| **Authentication** | AWS Amplify Auth (SSO) | Google + Apple Sign-In |
| **Data Storage** | AWS Amplify Data | GraphQL API with DynamoDB |
| **State Management** | React hooks | useState, useReducer, custom hooks |
| **Build Tool** | Vite | PWA support via vite-plugin-pwa |
| **Validation** | Zod | Form and data validation |
| **Testing** | Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E) | See package.json scripts |

## Key Dependencies

### Frontend
- `react` / `react-dom` - UI framework
- `typescript` - Type safety
- `tailwindcss` - Utility-first CSS
- `lucide-react` - Icon library
- `react-toastify` - Toast notifications
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `leaflet` / `react-leaflet` - Maps

### Backend
- `@aws-amplify/backend` - Amplify Gen 2 backend
- `@aws-amplify/backend-cli` - CLI tools
- `aws-amplify` - Frontend AWS integration
- `aws-amplify/auth` - Authentication
- `aws-amplify/data` - Data client

### Build & Dev Tools
- `vite` - Build tool and dev server
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` - React plugin
- `vite-plugin-pwa` - PWA support
- `eslint` - Linting
- `vitest` - Unit tests
- `playwright` - E2E testing

## Architecture Decisions

### Why These Technologies?

**React + TypeScript**: Type safety, strong ecosystem, self-documenting code

**Tailwind CSS**: Rapid development, consistent design, no custom CSS files

**AWS Amplify Gen 2**: Type-safe data, SSO, serverless backend

**Vite**: Fast HMR, efficient builds

**Leaflet**: Lightweight maps for ride locations and search

**Vitest / Playwright**: Unit and E2E coverage

## No Router Library

View-based routing in `App.tsx` (no React Router):
- `currentView` state drives which component is rendered
- Views: home, map, findARideMap, bookRide, bookRideDetails, bookRideConfirm, bookaRideRequest, offerRide, ridePlannerChat, pools, connections, account, terms, license
- Session storage used for view restoration on refresh (see `VIEW_STORAGE_KEY` in App.tsx)
